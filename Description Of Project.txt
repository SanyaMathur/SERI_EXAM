KEY FEATURES OF THIS PROJECT:

1) Data Fetching:

Uses useEffect to fetch user data from https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users on component mount.

Stores the fetched data in the data state.

2) Search Functionality:

Search state holds the current search query.

Filters sortedData based on whether the user's name includes the search term (case-insensitive).

3) Sorting Mechanism:

SortConfig state tracks the current sort key and direction (asc or desc).

Clicking on column headers (ID, Name, Email) triggers sorting.

Sorting is handled via React.useMemo for performance optimization.

4) Inline Editing:

EditingUserId tracks which user is currently being edited.

EditFormData stores temporary values for name and email during editing.

Provides Edit, Save, and Cancel buttons for each row.

Updates the data state with edited values on save.

5) Memoization:

SortedData is memoized to avoid unnecessary re-sorting on every render.

Ensures efficient rendering especially with larger datasets.

6) UI Elements:

Basic styling with inline styles and external CSS (style.css).

Table layout with clickable headers for sorting and input fields for editing.

Search bar at the top for filtering by name.
