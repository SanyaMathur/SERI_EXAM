# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.

Project Description

This is a frontend project built with React.js that fetches data from an external API and displays it dynamically in a table.
The table supports searching, sorting, and inline editing of selected fields.

The data is fetched from:
https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users

Key Features:
1) Data Fetching

Uses useEffect to fetch user data on component mount.

Stores the fetched data in the data state.

2) Search Functionality

Search input allows filtering the table by Name.

Case-insensitive search for better usability.

3) Sorting

Clicking on column headers (ID, Name, Email) sorts data.

sortConfig state tracks sorting key & order (ascending/descending).

Sorting logic is optimized with React.useMemo.

4) Inline Editing

Allows editing of Name and Email fields directly in the table.

Buttons:

Edit → enable editing mode.

Save → save updates back into the table.

Cancel → discard changes.

Updates reflect instantly in the data state.

5 )Performance Optimization

Memoization ensures efficient rendering by preventing unnecessary re-sorting.

Optimized for larger datasets.

6 )UI

Clean table layout with clickable sortable headers.

Simple search bar above the table.

External CSS styling (style.css).
